<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our game will be targeting players who are technologically savy and wouldn't mine learning about Barbados in the form of a game. The app will allow players to traverse through various areas in Barbados and interact with some of our popular folklore and be able to watch popular events, all in all, informing them more about our culture in a simple to play gaming format. Not only are games generally entertaining and addicting, but the aim is to also raise a player's curiosity about the origin from which the game is based on.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
