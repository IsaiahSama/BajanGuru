The old man's tales will also contain interactions with Popular folklore such as Anansi the Spider, Shaggy Bear, Ossi More etc.
Outside of the Old Man's tales,the old man will send the player on quests for items which will require the player to explore popular areas such as Harrison Cave and Gun hill Station and other random areas like forests where they will encounter enemies like Green Monkeys and fight Bosses like Bull Cow, Mother Hen and Bumblebee, and also get recovery items like Mangoes and Tamarinds.<br><br>

By this time, the player will have aged significantly, and will eventually resign and take the Old Man's Place as a story teller. A cutscene will then play of the player interacting with another young child, and eventually passing away at which point the game will end.</p>
