Name:Isaiah Carrington<br><br>
Date Of Birth: 3rd August 2003<br><br>
Skill: Programmer<br><br>
Bio: I, Isaiah, am currently at an intermediate level in 7 coding languages which are HTML, CSS, JS, Java(recently started), C++, Pascal and Python 2/3 and soon to start Lua and Unity. Some of my favourite apps are  mainly MMORPG games because the concept of being able to make an entire world and have full control over every thing that happens inside of it greatly intrigues me, and being able to be whoever or whatever I want to be along with the ability to connect with other players world wide is quite exhilarating. Some of these games include Smite, TERA (The Exiled Realm of Arborea), Terraria, and even Roblox to a certain extent.
